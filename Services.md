# Services

The goal is to understand how services work in Angular.

## Structure
- App
    - Module
        - Services
        - Components
        - Directives
        - Pipes
        
## Fetching Data
Use HttpClient Module to fetch json.

## Example
Understand using async to create dynamic components.
Enum is great for categorical data.
ProviderIn has global scope.
