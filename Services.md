# Services

The goal is to understand how services work in Angular.

## Structure
- App
    - Module
        - Services
        - Components
        - Directives
        - Pipes
        
## Architecture
When having a prototype, it is paramount to break the prototype down into my understanding of Angular components first.
The purpose is to get a general picture of how many components might be needed.

## onInit
