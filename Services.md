# Services

The goal is to understand how services work in Angular.

## What's the difference
- Fetch data
- Only works with data, no html
- Singleton

## Understand Class
- Class
- Class Instance

## Understand Scope
- Public
- Private
- Protected
      
## Fetching Data
Use HttpClient Module to fetch json.

## Example
Understand using async to create dynamic components.
Enum is great for categorical data.
ProviderIn has global scope.
